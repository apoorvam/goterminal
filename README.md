func main() {
  
  # get an instance of writer
  writer := goterminal.New()

    # add your text to writer's buffer
    writer.Buf.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf("Downloading (%d/100) bytes...\n", i))
    # write to terminal
    writer.Write()
    time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 200)

    # clear the text written by previous write, so that it can be re-written.
    writer.Clear()

  # reset the writer
  writer.Reset()

}
```

### Usage

* Create a `Writer` instance.
* Add your text to writer's buffer and call `Write()` to print text on Terminal. This can be called any number of times.
* Call `Clear()` to move the cursor to position where first `Write()` started so that it can be over-written.
* `Reset()` writer, so it clears its state for next Write.
